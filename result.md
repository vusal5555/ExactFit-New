As an Indian founder, my instinct was to price low ($5-$10/month) to be competitive. My early US-based beta users told me that price felt 'cheap' and made them question the tool's depth. I researched competitors and realized my tool offered unique data (like the posting time heatmaps on https://reoogle.com ). I priced it at $29/month, positioning it as a professional tool.

Lastly don't forget the unit economics, if your app costs let's say $5 per customer (fixed and variable costs) then go for maybe a markup such that you earn 80% gross profit, as you'll have to spend a lot in marketing and salaries if you have employees and your net profit margin drops to 40-50% which is still very nice. API costs can rack up like anything so have some buffer revenue and checks to prevent such hikes in costs in the first place.

Start by asking users what your product replaces and what that currently costs in time or money, then back into a value metric (seats, projects, reports) they instantly “get.” Run 2–3 price points as silent A/B tests on your landing page and watch trial-to-paid and 60–90 day retention, not just signups. I like using Stripe + ProfitWell and sometimes Baremetrics for this, then Pulse for Reddit to see what your exact users complain about paying for so your tiers map to real pain, not guesses.
