My question is given the world moving forward should we go about this role or keep looking for more genAI focused roles? My question comes from the fact that though major companies are rushing towards agents and genAI solution I still see many roles for forecasting and conventional roles. What should be my thinking about the transition.\n\nP.S. Pay is same as my current role so salary is not a problem",
